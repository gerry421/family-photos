His multifaceted career spanned roles as a merchant, builder, surveyor, iron manufacturer, and judge, showcasing his versatility and dedication to his community.

His valor extended to the Battle of Bennington on August 16, 1777, *==where he met his end==*. His son, Hon. William P. Walker, poignantly recounted in a letter to Rev. Dr. Shepard:

Mrs. Plunkett’s long acquaintance with Mrs. Davis rendered her paper exceedingly interesting and valuable, while Miss Dawes, although of a younger generation, knowing Mrs. Davis as intimately as she did, was well qualified to express her appreciation of Mrs. Davis’ characteristics and life work. In the acquaintance it has been my privilege to have with the wonderful women of Pittsfield, my native town, it perhaps might be said, without detracting in the least from the merits of others, that no other two women could have been selected to pen these memorial tributes who were better fitted, intellectually, to perform that work. The great beauty of the tributes, however, is the warm-hearted spontaneity which animates every line. I should suggest that the descendants of Mrs. Davis read carefully these papers, for certainly all who knew Mrs. Davis, rich and poor, high and low, will join in the appreciation these friends have written of her character._"

at it, speech so sweet that all loved to hear him speak to them, a 
smile so winning that all loved to meet it, and a disposition so gentle 
that none could receive offence; but I mean that the natural traits 
of character were so permeated by the spirit of Christ that the 
whole man was made uncommon.”
```

“Died, at Lenox, on Monday morning last, after a few days’ confinement, full of years and full of honors,’ the Hon. William Walker aged 80... He was amongst the few remaining of the efficient and gallant actors in the Revolutionary War.”

## **2. English Rockwell Ancestry**

### **Founding Members**

1. **William Rockwell**
    
    - **Marriage:** Susan Capen at Holy Trinity Church, Dorchester, County of Dorset
    - **Birth:** Baptized February 6, 1591, at Fitzhead, Somerset
    - **Death:** Not specified
2. **John Rockwell (William’s Brother)**
    
    - **Birth:** Baptized July 5, 1588, at Fitzhead, Somerset
    - **Marriage:** Wilmet (or Wilmoth) Cade on February 22, 1619 (or 1619-20) at Fitzhead
    - **Death:** February 23, 1636-7, buried at Fitzhead
    - **Residence at Death:** Windsor, Connecticut
    - **Children:** Richard and others (specific children not detailed)

### **Key Events and Anecdotes**

- **Richard Rockwell:**
    
    - **Relation:** Son of William Rockwell
    - **Marriage:** Outside Fitzhead; married children include Thomas, Joseph, Nathaniell, Samuell, Deberath, and Mary.
    - **Ancestral Claim:** Traditional story claims descent from Sir Ralph de Rocheville, a Norman knight who fought for Empress Maud or Matilda, daughter of Henry I of England, and widow of Henry V of the Holy Roman Empire.
    - **Research Status:** No confirmation found for the connection to Sir Ralph de Rocheville; investigations are ongoing.
- **Rockwell Family Settlement:**
    
    - **Location:** Somerset, near Taunton, bounded by Taunton, Wellington, Ashbrittle, and Fitzhead.
    - **Other Settlements:** Rockwells also found in Holy Trinity parish, Dorchester, and Lambeth, Surrey.
    - **Migration Patterns:** Minimal Rockwells living in England today; majority moved to New England.

### **Research Challenges**

- **Spelling Variations:** Rockwell may be spelled as Rokell, Rockell, Rockall, Rockhall, Rockill, Rockhill, etc.
- **Coat of Arms:** Unclear origin and relation to similar coats for Bekewell or Beckwell families.
- **Historical Records:** Limited evidence linking English Rockwells to the Somerset or Bristol groups.

### **Direct Excerpts**

- **Will Excerpt:**
    
    ```
    In transcribing, punctuation and “u” and “v” have been confoimed to modern usage.
    ```
    
- **Historical Note:**
    
    ```
    It was her father’s wish that she pursue the study of music 
    ```
    
- **Quoted Research Note:**
    
    ```
    The investigations in England, which are still in progress, will, it 
    is hoped, lead to the publication of a pamphlet probably to be entitled 
    “Rockwell Wills and Records in England and the American Family 
    Legend.” It will subject to careful examination the story printed in 
    Henry Ensign Rockwell’s “Rockwell Family in America,” that we are 
    descended from Sir Ralph de Rocheville, a Norman knight who came 
    over to England and fought for the Empress Maud or Matilda, daughter 
    of Henry I of England, widow of Henry V of the Holy Roman Empire, 
    mother of Henry II the first Plantagenet upon the English throne. 
    ```

## **3. Historical Context and Research Progress**

### **Ancestral Claims and Investigations**

- **Traditional Claims:** Descent from Sir Ralph de Rocheville, a Norman knight with notable historical ties.
- **Current Status:** No evidence found in English records; skepticism remains.
- **Future Research:** Ongoing investigations aim to confirm or refute traditional ancestral claims.

### **Geographical Distribution**

- **Somerset Group:**
    - **Location:** Somerset, near Taunton, England.
    - **Notable Settlements:** Fitzhead, Holy Trinity parish Dorchester, and Lambeth, Surrey.
- **Outside Somerset:**
    - **Locations:** Lambeth, Surrey; Rochester, Kent; Ely; and others.
    - **Notable Sites:** Rockwell End near Hambleden, Buckinghamshire; Holy Trinity parish in Dorchester; Rockells Farm in Essex.

### **Migration Patterns**

- **Early Settlers:** William Rockwell and his brother John Rockwell settled in New England.
- **Modern Distribution:** Few Rockwells remain in England; most descendants are in New England, USA.

### **Genealogical Challenges**

- **Name Variations:** Multiple spellings complicate tracing lineage.
- **Record Gaps:** Lack of records linking traditional claims to verified ancestors.
- **Heraldic Issues:** Unclear origins and connections of the Rockwell coat of arms.

### **Direct Excerpts**

- **Heraldic Problem Statement:**
    
    ```
    The heraldic problem is, what is the origin of the Rockwell coat of 
    arms, as given in William Berry’s Encyclopaedia Heraldica (i, London 
    1828, page 51b), and what is its relation to the very similar coat given 
    for Bekewell or Beckwell?
    ```
    
- **Research Aspirations:**
    
    ```
    It is fascinating to work out possible explanations for our family 
    name; but derivations do not prove descent. Many English yeomen drew 
    their surnames from villages called after a great family to which they 
    were not related. At the same time, many yeomen are descended from the 
    younger sons of knights or nobles.
    ```
    
- **Traditional Settlement Description:**
    
    ```
    Now it is possible for us New England Rockwells to trace our 
    undoubted descent to a village in the uplands of Somerset, on the edge 
    of the fertile vale of Taunton, with its flowering hedgerows, Gothic church 
    tower, and unmarked graves kept green throughout the generations by the 
    soft clouds that drive in from the nearby sea.
    ```

## **Conclusion**

**Chapter VII** provides a detailed exploration of the **English ancestry of the Rockwell family**, highlighting both documented facts and traditional claims. The chapter underscores the complexities of genealogical research, especially when dealing with historical records, name variations, and unverified ancestral stories. While traditional narratives connect the Rockwell family to Norman nobility, current research lacks concrete evidence, leading to ongoing investigations and skepticism.

The meticulous transcription of Honer Rockwell's will offers valuable insights into the family's early American history, showcasing inheritance patterns and familial relationships. Simultaneously, the challenges in tracing the English Rockwell lineage emphasize the importance of continued research and verification to establish a credible genealogical record.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Honer Rockwell's Will:** Provides a snapshot of familial relationships and inheritance practices in 17th-century England.
- **English Ancestry Claims:** Traditional stories link the Rockwells to Norman nobility, but evidence remains unconfirmed.
- **Research Efforts:** Ongoing investigations aim to uncover more definitive connections, though challenges persist due to name variations and limited historical records.
- **Geographical Focus:** Somerset, Taunton, and surrounding areas are central to the Rockwell family's ancestral roots, with notable settlements and land transactions documented.

- **William Rockwell:**
    - **Chart Error:** Birth year listed as **1595**.
